# OpenGnsys

The OpenGnsys Project (pronounced _Open Genesis_) brings together the combined efforts of
several Spanish Public Universities to provide a number of free and open source tools for
managing and deploying computers. These tools supply a complete, versatile and intuitive
system that allows the arrangement, installation and deployment of different operating
systems. 

OpenGnsys is based on a modular architecture separated into different service layers which
allows its implementation in several educational and organizational IT environments, both
in a centralized or distributed way.  The main management of the system is carried out by
means of a simple web interface which supports delegated administration. OpenGnsys is also
suitable for isolated environments, being able to work in network failure conditions
(offline mode).
